You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /home/hammad/Desktop/rahmah-makan

[info] 
=== Project Setup
[info] 
[info] First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
[info] You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.

=== Hosting Setup
[info] 
[info] Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
[info] will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
[info] have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.
