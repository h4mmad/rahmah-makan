## Rahmah Makan

Based on one of United Nation's sustainable goals of eradicating hunger, Rahmah Makan is a web app that enables donors to 
donate food to community fridges spread across Penang. Donors are able to check the capacity of fridges through an IoT camera module which detects objects in the fridges. Donors are then able to navigate to the fridges and place the food items.
